# Hello there! #

I'm Brent, a 40-something who went back to school at City College of San Francisco for CS in 2020 and realized his passion lies in tutoring and teaching coding to others. I hope to transfer to SF State University after another... um... 2 years? 5? I'm allergic to math (I break out in EEEEEEEEEEE). Weird for a CS student, right? What I want to do with CS is teach. I currently am head tutor at CCSF and I am a teacher with Mission Bit, a non-profit that helps get quality tech introductory education to deserving students. I have taught their Intro to Web/CSS class and Intro to Python. In the classroom or in the computer lab, you can find me drawing on whiteboards, cutting up paper and making mockups, and walking stick figures up and over stairs to better engage students with the content.
